Build a production-ready SaaS web application for task tracking between freelancers and clients.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

Styling: TailwindCSS

Backend: Django + Django REST Framework

Database: PostgreSQL

Containerization: Docker + Docker Compose

Authentication: JWT-based authentication

Deployment-ready configuration

=====================================
PROJECT IDEA

The platform allows:

Freelancers to:

Create projects

Break projects into tasks

Assign a unique track ID / token to each client per project

Update task status (Todo / In Progress / Done)

Log daily progress updates

Upload small attachments (optional)

Send the client track ID so that the client can access a read-only dashboard

Clients to:

Access a secure dashboard via the freelancer-issued track ID

View tasks and project progress relevant only to their ID

See tasks from multiple freelancers, each filtered by project/client ID

Comment on each task for clarifications or modification requests

Cannot modify task status, attachments, or other freelancer-only data

=====================================
